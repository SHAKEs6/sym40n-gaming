### Sign-Up Problem Resolved!
**What was wrong:**

**What I fixed:**
✅ Added `<script src="app.js"></script>` to signup.html
✅ Added fallback localStorage handling
✅ Better error catching and messages
✅ Color-coded success/error displays
✅ Proper data validation

**Test now:** http://localhost:8000/signup.html
